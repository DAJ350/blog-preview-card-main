## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Figma 

### What I learned

I started this project thinking it would be a walk in the park. BOY was I wrong. I got a brutal reminder that I am still at the start of my learning ðŸ˜….

My main struggle was figuring out how to closely match the sizing of the elements to the dimensions provided in the design files without relying fixed measurements and media queries. 

For a while I thought the issue was sporuting from the size I set the entire card to but in the end I realised that it was a font-sizing problem. Once I realised this, I began looking in the direction of fluid typography and stumbled across the clamp() function.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I need more practice with fluid typography and creating responsive designs over all. I look forward to practicing this with more Frontend Mentor projects. 

### Useful resources

- [Clamp() MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This helped me learn the basics of using the clamp() function.
